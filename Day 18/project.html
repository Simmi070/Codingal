        <h2>Chips</h2>
        <p>Potato chips were famously invented in 1853 by chef George Crum at Moon's Lake House in Saratoga Springs, NY. Annoyed by
        a customer complaining that his fries were too thick, Crum sliced potatoes paper-thin, fried them until crisp, and
        salted them heavily. Initially known as "Saratoga Chips," they gained popularity and became a staple snack.</p>

        <h1>Section 2</h1>
        <p>Key Moments in Potato Chip History:
        1853 Origin: George Crum (born George Speck) invented them as a crispy, salty alternative to thick, soggy fried
        potatoes.
        Early 1900s Mass Production: Entrepreneur William Tappenden began selling chips in grocery stores, initially out of
        barrels.
        Packaging Revolution: In the 1920s, Laura Scudder invented the first wax-paper bag, allowing chips to stay fresh and be
        transported.
        Flavoring Evolution: In the 1950s, Joe "Spud" Murphy, founder of Irish company Tayto, invented the first flavored
        crisps: Cheese & Onion and Salt & Vinegar.
